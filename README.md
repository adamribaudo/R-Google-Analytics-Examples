# R and Google Analytics Use Cases

## Introduction

Your web analytics data is trapped! Google Analytics provides you with a handful of built-in reports and features, but your data has so much more potential. Fortunately, the data-oriented programming language, R, can easily connect to Google Analytics and produce results that go far beyond the features of GA. Furthermore, R provides operational benefits to analytics teams who wish to collaborate on reproduceable analyses.

## Examples

- Quantifying the impact of events on time series data using the CausalImpact library: [Tutorial](https://adamribaudo.github.io/R-Google-Analytics-Examples/Tutorial-Causal-Impact.nb.html) / [Code](Tutorial-Causal-Impact.Rmd)
- Google Analytics audits via scripted R Markdown file: [Output](https://adamribaudo.github.io/R-Google-Analytics-Examples/GA-Audit-Tool.html) / [Code](GA-Audit-Tool.Rmd)
- Recreating the Google Analytics explorer graph & table in R: [Output](https://adamribaudo.github.io/R-Google-Analytics-Examples/GA-explorer-in-R.nb.html) / [Code](https://adamribaudo.github.io/R-Google-Analytics-Examples/GA-explorer-in-R.Rmd)
- Exploring GA segment overlap with Venn diagrams: [Output](https://adamribaudo.github.io/R-Google-Analytics-Examples/GA-segment-overlap.html) / [Code](GA-segment-overlap.Rmd)
- Running Market Basket Analysis with GA data: [Blog Post](https://adamribaudo.github.io/R-Google-Analytics-Examples/GA-Market-Basket-Analysis.html) / [Code](GA-Market-Basket-Analysis.Rmd)
- Revese Path Analysis: [Demo](https://reversepath-atcv7qt3fq-ue.a.run.app/) / [Code](GA-Reverse-Path-Shiny.R)
- Pulling Google's [web vital metrics](https://web.dev/vitals/) from GA: [Output](https://adamribaudo.github.io/R-Google-Analytics-Examples/GA-Web-Vitals.html) / [Code](GA-Web-Vitals.Rmd). Assumes that these metrics exist in GA using the process described in [this blog post](https://www.noisetosignal.io/2020/05/add-web-vitals-to-google-analytics/)

## TODO

- Demonstration of visualizations available in R that wouldn't be possible otherwise
- Slide output to automate monthly reporting
- Google Cloud Runner demonstration to automate processing
- Basic statistical tests
- Joining data from multiple sources
- Advanced segments + comparing greater than 4 segments at a time
- Anomaly detection
- Offline A/B testing
- Working with unsampled data
- Collaborate on version-controlled R scripts + R Studio Pro
- User journey maps using igraph
